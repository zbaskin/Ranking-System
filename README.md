# Ranking System

This application is designed to take two random elements of a larger list and generates an overall weighted ranking of those list elements. The inspiration was to be able to rank the 30 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, but the list can be edited in ```films.js``` or ```ranking-system/films.js```
